## üõ† Design Decisions & Challenges

### 1Ô∏è‚É£ Handling Missing Author Names
The API only provided author IDs instead of names, so an additional request was needed to fetch user details. To optimize performance:
- **Transformed API response**: Combined posts and user data before storing them.
- **Stored transformed data in Redux**: Eliminated redundant API calls for each blog page.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Optimizing API Calls
Since each blog page required an author's name but calling the API repeatedly would be inefficient:
- Stored processed blog posts in Redux.
- This eliminated API calls when navigating between blog pages.
